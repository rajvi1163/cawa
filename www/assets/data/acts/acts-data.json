The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and the State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCRs) have been entrusted with the task of monitoring children’s right to education under Section 31 of the RTE Act, 2009. This Ministry has also issued Guidelines/Advisory to all the States and Union Territories for elimination of Corporal Punishment in Schools.
The Affiliation Byelaws of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) empower the School Managing Committee to place an employee under suspension if charged with cruelty with any student or employee of the school. CBSE has also issued guidelines to schools for ensuring an atmosphere free from fear in each affiliated school.
The effects of various forms of mental harassment or psychological maltreatment have shown that
(a) Combinations of verbal abuse and emotional neglect tend to produce the most powerfully negative outcomes.;
(b) Psychological maltreatment is a better predictor of detrimental developmental outcomes for young children than the severity of physical injury experienced by them.;
(c) It is the indicator most related to behavior problems for children and adolescents;
(d) Psychological abuse is a stronger predictor of both depression and low self-esteem than physical abuse.;",

In 1956 India passed the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act, 1956 (SITA). The act was further amended and changed in 1986, resulting in the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act also know as PITA.

The first section of the act has provisions that outline the illegality of prostitution and the punishment for owning a brothel or a similar establishment, or for living of earnings of prostitution as is in the case of a pimp.
 Section five of the act states that if a person procures, induces or takes a child for the purpose of prostitution then the prison sentence is a minimum of seven years but can be extended to life

The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976 talks of the illegality of slave or bonded labour with reference to both adults and children. The latest ILO report stated that every one in six children work, with millions engaged in bonded or forced labour. The act renders all bonded labour systems (agreements, pacts, tradition, custom, etc) to be null and void and hence frees all bonded labours from their debt to the creditors. It also bans any person shall pursue or compel a person to enter into forced labour or a bonded labour system. Victims of bonded labour are not liable to repay their debt, and any property that was taken from the bonded labourer is to be restored. All legal proceeding against bonded labourers for inability to replay their debt or abide by the bonded system are dismissed. As per the law, the bonded labour can not be evicted from his home even when the bonded system has been dissolved. Creditors are not permitted to accept any payments and those who do are punishable up to three years of imprisonment and fine. The act allows for the state to appoint a district magistrate and officers authorised by him to over see the legal implementation of the act. It also requires that the state set up vigilance committees in every district or sub-section. These committees are responsible for ensuring the full rehabilitation and recovery of all bonded labourers, defending any suit against a bonded labourer and advising the district magistrate to take action and uphold the law. The act maintains that burden of proof lies on the creditor to prove a particular debt is not bonded in nature.",
            "punishment":"•	Any per who extends an advance on bonded labour is liable to imprisonment up to three years and a fine up to Rs. 2000.;
•	In addition to this punishment, a person who extracts bonded labour in the form of a bonded system from an individual is liable to pay that individual Rs 5 for every day of labour extracted out of the fine. ;
•	The same punishment is levied against any individual who fails to return property to a bonded labourer that was procured as part of the bonded system. A person who had abetted an offence is also liable to the same punishment as a person who has committed the offence.

Hence both the UNCRC and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights outline children's right to food. There are a number of constitutions in the world that safeguard a child's right to food. Such as article 44 of the Columbia constitution states "Children have fundamental rights to: life, integrity, health and social security, adequate food".
The National Food Security Act, 2013 also called as ‘The Right to Food Act” aims to provide subsidized food grains to two thirds of India's 1.2 billion people. The Act categorizes the population into an Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) group, a priority group and an excluded category. The Antyodaya Anna Yojana is a scheme launched by the Central Government in 2000.The excluded category is retained at 25 per cent of the rural and 50 per cent of the urban population. The AAY category will be as per existing norms (about 10 per cent of all households). The Act provides different entitlements to groups. The poorest of the poor (the AAY group) will receive 35 kg of food grain/family/month while others (the priority group) will receive 5 kg of food grain/person/month.
The Act envisages covering upto 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population under TPDS, with uniform entitlement of 5 kg per person per month. However, since Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households constitute poorest of the poor, and are presently entitled to 35 kg per household per month, entitlement of existing AAY households will be protected at 35 kg per household per month.
Importantly, it includes the Midday Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Services scheme and the Public Distribution System. Further, the NFSA 2013 recognizes maternity entitlements. The Act also has a special focus on the nutritional support to women and children.
 Besides meal to pregnant women and lactating mothers during pregnancy and six months after the child birth, such women will also be entitled to receive maternity benefit of not less than Rs. 6,000. Children upto 14 years of age will be entitled to nutritious meals as per the prescribed nutritional standards. In case of non-supply of entitled food grains or meals, the beneficiaries will receive food security allowance.
